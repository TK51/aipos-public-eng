## 🧠 What Is This?

**AIPOS-PUBLIC** is a no-install, paste-ready framework for controlling how AI (like ChatGPT) behaves inside a session.

This is not a plugin.  
It’s not a product.  
It’s a **spec** — a single `.txt` that defines how AI behaves during your session:

- Define the tone, style, and role of the AI  
- Control output structure and prompt grammar  
- Run sessions with reproducible quality and precision  
- Enable structured feedback behavior  
- Log your results cleanly

The goal is simple:  
**Structure kills randomness.**  
This file brings structure — and clarity — to AI-powered work **and output**.  
It controls not just *what* the AI says — but *how* it says it. 
At session end, you can generate a clean, extractable **session log** to track your work.

> This file was born from failure — the failure to get consistent, reliable, system-grade output from AI.  
> So I built one instead.

## ✂️ How to Use It (No Install Required)

### 🔽 OPTION 1: Get the Config File via direct link

> 📎 [AIPOS-Session-Config.txt](./AIPOS-Session-Config)

1. Download the file or copy its raw content  
2. (Optional) Edit your role, tone, context, or session rules inside the file
3. Save your file with changes. You can use it furter as template 
4. Open ChatGPT (or another AI tool)  
5. Paste the file itself or its contents into the chat at the beginning of your session  
6. You’re now running AIPOS with structure and clarity — no plugins, no setup

### 📱 OPTION 2: Scan QR to Open Config Location on GitHub

> ![QR_LINK_README.png](./QR_LINK_README.png)  
> *(Scan from your phone to view the config file. You can download or copy it manually.)*

🛑 No auto-downloads.  
🧾 This just opens a plain text file hosted on GitHub.

## 🔧 What’s Inside the Config File?

`AIPOS-Session-Config.txt` includes:

- ✅ Your user profile block (role, language, mindset) — editable  
- ✅ Preferred tone — default: `cross-functional`, `truecut` (user can define others)  
- ✅ Output formatting — `markdown`, `rawtext`, `raw.md`, `python`  
  - ⚠️ `Markdown Only: true` is enforced unless you change it  
- ✅ AI role behavior — `multi-role` active; can be locked to fixed roles  
- ✅ Supported command triggers — freestyle or voice-style  
- ✅ Closure behavior — disabled (no friendly exits)  
- ✅ Output logging — local timestamp embedded  
- ✅ Header/Footer — active by default for session structure  
- ✅ QR compatibility — designed for visible, mobile-safe access

> All parts of the config can be edited, copied, or templated — modular by design.

## 🧨 Why Use This?

If you’ve ever felt that AI output is:

- Too vague  
- Too polite  
- Too inconsistent  

This config lets you fix that by controlling the session itself.

> You define the structure. The output follows.
