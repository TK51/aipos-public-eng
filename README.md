## What Is AIPOS?

AIPOS (AI Personal Operational System) is a manual method to train and control ChatGPT during a live session using text-based configuration files.

It enforces tone, behavior, and formatting logic based on your declared setup ‚Äî role, structure, expectations ‚Äî with zero fluff.

**Main purpose:**  
To create a straight-cut pathway to better outcomes ‚Äî by stripping fluff, blocking hallucinated structure, and stopping the endless loop of floating model improvisation.

## Key Files

- `aipos-cfg-base-cynical.txt` ‚Äî Main config  
- `aipos-method-card.md` ‚Äî Core approach explained  
- `aipos-commands-reference.md` ‚Äî Runtime commands  
- `aipos-truth-checkpoint.md` ‚Äî Evidence of execution  
- `aipos-system-rules.md` ‚Äî Activation + paste rules  
- `TRAINING-GUIDE.md` ‚Äî How to teach this method to others  
- `NAMING-RULES.md` ‚Äî Required file naming scheme  

Interpreter file (`aipos-interpreter.md`) must be loaded first if config logic is expected to activate automatically.

---

## How To Use It

- Paste files into ChatGPT manually  
- Or upload them as a `.zip` archive  
- Run `aiposrun` to activate  

Order matters.  
Config without interpreter = ignored.  
Interpreter without config = no rules applied.

## What You Can Do With It

- Train your own model sessions manually  
- Apply tone, role, and behavioral constraints across tasks  
- Develop enhanced usage patterns for both desktop and mobile use  
- Create situational templates using the provided tools  
- Teach others how to run AI on their terms using your own adjusted configs  
- Scale systematic, repeatable output quality without relying on random prompts

---

## What This Is Not

- A plugin  
- A memory tool  
- A shortcut  

There are **no instant results**.  
The ‚Äúmagic‚Äù only shows up after you stop chasing magic.

This system exists to **replace impulse prompts with controlled execution** ‚Äî and it only works if *you* work it.

---

## Final Note

AIPOS is built to behave.  
Whether you do the same ‚Äî is on you.
