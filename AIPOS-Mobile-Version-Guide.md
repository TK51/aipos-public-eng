### 2. Tap to Open File  
- Tap the link in your browser  
- On GitHub, tap **Download**  
- Open the `.txt` file on your phone  
- Edit it if needed, then save

---

### 3. Paste into ChatGPT  
- Open ChatGPT (mobile app or browser)  
- Either:  
  - Paste the full text content of the config as your first message  
  - **Or**, upload the `.txt` file directly if your app supports it  
- Make sure this is the **first message** in the session — before any prompts or questions 

You’ll see a confirmation like:  
> Config loaded. Role: multi-role.  
> Tone: polite • constructive • critical • practical.  
> Timestamp: [your local time]

---

### 4. Begin Structured Session  
You’re now running AIPOS from your phone.  
The assistant will follow your declared structure, tone, and behavior logic.

## ✅ Works Great For

- Mobile-only users  
- Quick feedback or micro-sessions

---

## 🧾 Quick Reminders

- Always paste the **full config** before sending other prompts  
- If your session resets or loses tone, just re-paste  
- You can customize the config before each run  
- No plugin, no extension — just structured text
