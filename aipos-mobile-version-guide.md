## AIPOS Mobile Version Guide

---

### Purpose

This document explains how to run AIPOS from a mobile device — no desktop, no plugin, no installation.

If your phone has:
- A camera  
- Basic file access  
- ChatGPT open in browser or app  

…then you can run a fully structured session with a single paste.

---

### What You’ll Do

- Scan the AIPOS QR code  
- Download the config file (`aipos-cfg-base-cynical.txt`)  
- Open or edit it on your phone (optional)  
- Paste the full contents into a new ChatGPT session  
- Type `aiposrun` (or `Aiposrun` on mobile) — and you’re live

---

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. Scan the QR  
Use your phone’s camera or QR reader:

'https://github.com/TK51/aipos-public-eng/blob/main/aipos-cfg-base-cynical.txt'

---

#### 2. Download the File  
- Tap the GitHub link  
- Scroll to `aipos-cfg-base-cynical.txt`  
- Tap “Download”  
- Save it to your local files

---

#### 3. Open the File  
- Use any notes or text editing app on your phone  
- Edit your role, tone, or footer preferences if needed  
- Copy the full text content

---

#### 4. Paste into ChatGPT  
- Open ChatGPT mobile browser or app  
- In a new session, paste the config as your first message  
- Then type:  
  - `aiposrun`  
  - or `Aiposrun` (if your phone autocapitalizes)

---

### Notes for Mobile Execution

- Config must be the first input — before prompts, questions, or tasks  
- You can modify the config per run  
- Footer logic and tone enforcement still apply  
- Works on both ChatGPT Free and Pro tiers  
- Uploading `.txt` works if your app supports it — otherwise, use paste method

---

### What It Enables

- Full runtime control from mobile  
- Structured micro-sessions while in transit  
- Free-tier compatibility with no memory reliance  
- No plugin overhead, no extensions

---

> Mobile ≠ Limited.  
> If your config runs, your structure runs — even in your pocket.
