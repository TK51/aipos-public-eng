## Who Built This

**Name:** Kay (aka Taras Khamardiuk)

**Location:** Greater Sacramento, CA â€” originally from Ukraine  
**Tone:** Cynical. Practical. Quietly precise.

## Why AIPOS Exists

Because repeating yourself to AI is bad design.  
Because prompts are brittle.  
Because behavior should be **structural**, not accidental.

AIPOS isnâ€™t a product. Itâ€™s a protocol.  
It runs without memory. It doesnâ€™t flatter you.  
It delivers clean, trackable, infrastructure-level output â€” if you build it that way.

## What I Actually Do

- Design systems that reduce waste and manual burden  
- Translate chaotic workflows into structured, repeatable steps  
- Build logic-first automation using Python, spreadsheets, and markup  
- Capture human operations as data  
- Document what others guess  
- Connect tools that were never meant to talk to each other  
- Make software do more with fewer moving parts  
- Design clarity into systems that drift  
- Replace dependence with reproducibility

## Core Beliefs

- Prompts aren't systems.  
- You donâ€™t fix AI drift with cleverness. You fix it with structure.  
- Sessions need runtime rules, not mood swings.  
- Context loss is a design flaw â€” not a user failure.

## Who This Is For

Not recruiters.  
Not followers.  
Not trend-chasers.

This system was built by someone who got tired of chasing memory and decided to build structure instead.  
If youâ€™ve felt the same â€” take what works and make it yours.
