## PURPOSE

This file describes the AIPOS method card — a compact visual that outlines how runtime enforcement works through session config logic. This is not a plugin, not a prompt — it's execution protocol in visual form.

## NOTE

The method card is a compact reference for anyone unfamiliar with AIPOS runtime logic. It works visually — no explanation needed. If they don’t get the document, they’ll get the diagram.
